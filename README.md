## 🚀 Features

### 🛡️ Encryption Modes

**Encryptor** supports two robust encryption modes:

#### 1. **Secure Mode** *(High Security)*
- Generates **different encrypted output** for the same input each time.
- Designed with **randomness** to prevent pattern analysis.
- Best suited for **confidential messaging** and privacy-first communication.

#### 2. **Fast Mode** *(High Speed)*
- Generates the **same encrypted output** for the same input.
- Prioritizes **performance** without compromising security.
- Useful for fast encoding/decoding in trusted environments.

> 🛡️ In both modes, **decryption is impossible** without the correct private key.
